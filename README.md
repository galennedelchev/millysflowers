A website i am currently bulding for my mom, consists of an online shop front, built on HTML CSS frontend, on PHP with MySQL backend.

I will try to update the github rep a few times a week as i am working on this project, so be aware this might not be the final version. The website is currently hosted on PLESK, under a different domain (previous project).
